# 🚀 MailForge — Automated HR Outreach Platform

MailForge is a full-stack automation tool designed to solve a real problem faced by job seekers: **sending personalized cold emails to hundreds or thousands of HR contacts efficiently**.

Instead of manually copying emails from a PDF and sending messages one-by-one, MailForge automates the entire outreach workflow.

Users can upload a directory of HR emails, create campaigns, attach their resume, and automatically send personalized emails while respecting Gmail safety limits.

# 🧠 The Real Problem

While searching for jobs, I obtained a **PDF directory containing around 1800 HR contacts** with details such as:

- HR Name
- Email Address
- Title
- Company

Sending cold emails manually required:

1. Opening the PDF
2. Copying the email
3. Opening Gmail
4. Writing or pasting the message
5. Attaching resume
6. Personalizing the email
7. Sending it

Repeating this **1800 times** would take **days of manual work**.

So I asked myself:

> “Why not build a system that automates this entire process?”

That idea led to the creation of **MailForge**.

# 💡 Solution

MailForge automates the entire cold-outreach process.

Users simply:

1️⃣ Upload a PDF containing HR contacts  
2️⃣ Create a campaign  
3️⃣ Upload their resume  
4️⃣ Write an email template  
5️⃣ Start the campaign

The system automatically:

- Extracts contacts from the PDF
- Validates email addresses
- Stores campaign data
- Sends emails one-by-one safely
- Tracks progress in real time

# ⚠️ Challenges Faced During Development

Building MailForge involved solving multiple technical challenges:

### Parsing structured data from PDFs
Extracting tabular contact data reliably required experimenting with PDF parsing tools.

### Handling large email lists
Managing thousands of emails required a proper queue system.

### Gmail spam protection
To prevent Gmail from blocking the account, delays and rate limits were implemented.

### Background processing
Campaigns needed to run in the background while updating progress on the dashboard.

### Deployment complexity
Separating frontend and backend deployments required careful configuration.
